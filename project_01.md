### Projects past and present

Here's where I'll post code, images, and supplementary data for the projects I'm working on

#### Trace metal acquisition by heterotrophic bacterioplankton with contrasting trophic strategies





This work is yet to appear in print, but I'm posting R markdown (using the wonderful [knitr package](http://yihui.name/knitr/)) for my analyses.

You can download the datasets used in these analyses from [here](/files/roseo_sar11_datatables.tar.gz) or here

[Fisher's exact test](/R_markdown/Hogle_etal_2015_fisher.html) for genome neighborhood enrichment

[Ordination](/R_markdown/Hogle_etal_2015_ordination.html) of genomes based on transporter abundance and diversity
