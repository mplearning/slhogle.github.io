### Projects past and present

Here's where I'll post code, images, and supplementary data for the projects I'm working on

#### Trace metal acquisition by heterotrophic bacterioplankton with contrasting trophic strategies

This work is yet to appear in print.

You can download the datasets used in these analyses from [here](/files/roseo_sar11_datatables.tar.gz) or here

* [Fisher's exact test](/R_markdown/Hogle_etal_2015_fisher.html) for genome neighborhood enrichment

* [Ordination](/R_markdown/Hogle_etal_2015_ordination.html) of genomes based on transporter abundance and diversity

* [Correlation analysis](/R_markdown/Hogle_etal_2015_correlation.html) between transporters and genome features

#### Fe-binding ligand production and microbial community composition in microcosm incubations
This work is yet to appear in print.

You can download the datasets used in these analyses from [here](/files/Fe_incubation_community_data.tar.gz) or here

* [Analyses](/R_markdown/CCE12_community_data.html) used to examine microbial community composition in micronutrient and macronutrient ammend microcosm incubations
