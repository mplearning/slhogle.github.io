<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I just recently published a <a href="http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2014/mt/c4mt00031e" target="_blank">review article</a> with <a href="http://scrippsscholars.ucsd.edu/kbarbeau" target="_blank">Kathy Barbeau</a> (my primary adviser) and <a href="http://www.geomar.de/en/mitarbeiter/fb2/ch/mgledhill/" target="_blank">Martha Gledhill</a> about the biogeochemistry of heme in marine systems. Unfortunately, the paper is not in an open access journal. If you don't have access and want to read it, message me for a copy.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>S</p>
