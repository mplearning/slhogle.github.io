<p>I am going to start keeping records of my code in posts on this blog because it will force me to keep my scripts organized and annotated - something I am currently having trouble with. It probably won't be pretty and it will be a little hacky since I am a total n00b. Still, it is my hope that my code snippets might be helpful to some other researchers out there. Languages I am working with currently are Ruby (bioruby), R,Â  and I guess some unix stuff. Stay tuned for more.</p>
