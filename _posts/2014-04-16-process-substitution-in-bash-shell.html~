<p>Say you want to use join to find and count the differences in two files each containing lines of biological sequence but those files are not sorted.</p>
<p>You could do</p>
{% highlight bash %}
sort seqfile1 > seqfile1.sorted
sort seqfile2 | join -v 2 - seqfile1.sorted | wc -l
{% endhighlight %}
This would give you the number of unmatched entries in seqfile1 when comparing it with seqfile2</p>
<p>One can also do this using process substitution</p>
{% highlight bash %}
join -v 2 <(sort seqfile1) <(sort seqfile2)  | wc -l
{% endhighlight %}
