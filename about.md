Thanks for vising my website and blog! I am currently a PhD candidate in the [Barbeau Laboratory](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/labs/barbeau/) at the [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/) and the [University of California, San Diego](http://www.ucsd.edu/). I did my undergraduate degree in Chemistry at [Earlham College](http://www.earlham.edu/) - a small liberal arts college in Richmond, Indiana.

Below is a non-technical(ish) description of my research and why it is important. If you are interested read on!

Bacteria are everywhere. Certain ones can make you sick, while an entire ecosystem of others living in your gut can make you well. Some bacteria have to eat carbon to grow (just like you and me) while others can perform photosynthesis to get their carbon for growth. And just like you and me, bacteria that eat carbon compounds "breath" oxygen and "exhale" carbon dioxide. Even though bacteria are physically very small, there are __SO MANY__ living on the planet that their net effect of eating, growing, breathing, exhaling, and moving around is enormous. As a scientist, I'm interested in bacteria that live in the ocean and eat the carbon compounds produced by marine photosynthesizers.

Half of all the biomass generated from photosynthesis on our planet exists in our oceans. Over time some of that biomass sinks all the way to the bottom of the ocean and is "trapped" for millions of years. The net effect is a __removal of carbon dioxide from the planetary system__. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, and our planet's climate is very sensitive to the amount in the atmosphere. As humans have burned more fossil fuels and released more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, the planet has warmed. 

_RIGHT NOW_ this warming is altering weather patterns, sea level, glacial cover, and many other things. A very important part of understanding how our planet's climate is changing is to determine the strength of the __biological pump__. The biological pump is essentially what determines the propotion of sinking biomass in the ocean that becomes trapped at the bottom and can no longer warm the planet as carbond dioxide. A "strong" biological pump traps a lot of carbon in the bottom of the ocean. In a system with a "weak" pump, more of that carbon is respired back into carbon dioxide. The effect of bacteria eating and respiring the carbon that would otherwise be sinking to the ocean floor is called the __microbial loop__.

__We need to better understand how the microbial loop works in order to better understand the biological pump and how our oceans and climate will respond to anthropogenic warming.__ A better understanding of the bacteria that live in the ocean and how they interact in communities will contribute to a clearer picture of how our planet works on a system-wide scale and how it may change with a warming climate.

My PhD thesis is broadly focused on the specific molecular mechanisms and underlying genetics that bacteria and phytoplankton use to aquire iron from the unique chemical conditions of the marine environment. In turn, I am interested in how microbes influence the chemical speciation of iron in seawater and how they shape the ocean iron cycle. Much of my thesis looks at how bacteria of the marine Roseobacter lineage utilize exogenous heme and hemoproteins and the role heme uptake plays in the overall turnover of iron in the ocean. A better understanding of the iron cycle will provide us with a clearer picture of how iron interacts with the carbon cycle and Earth's climate.
