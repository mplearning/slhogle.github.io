My name is Shane, and I am fascinated by the bacteria living in the oceans!

I am currently a PhD candidate in the [Barbeau Laboratory](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/labs/barbeau/) at the [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/) and the [University of California, San Diego](http://www.ucsd.edu/). I did my undergraduate degree in Chemistry at [Earlham College](http://www.earlham.edu/) - a small liberal arts college in Richmond, Indiana. My PhD thesis is broadly focused on the specific molecular mechanisms and underlying genetics that bacteria and phytoplankton use to aquire iron from the unique chemical conditions of the marine environment. In turn, I am interested in how microbes influence the chemical speciation of iron in seawater and how they shape the ocean iron cycle. Much of my thesis looks at how bacteria of the marine Roseobacter lineage utilize exogenous heme and hemoproteins and the role heme uptake plays in the overall turnover of iron in the ocean.

I am slowly learning to be a bioinformaticist and work primarily in ruby and R, but right now I'm trying get up to speed with python... Topics will range from bioinformatics code snippets to rantings on navigating the mazes of academia.
