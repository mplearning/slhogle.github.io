<h1>hello there</h1>

	<div class="post-body">
      <p>My name is Shane Hogle. I study microbes in the sea.</p>

<p>I am currently a PhD candidate in the Marine Chemistry and Geochemistry curricular group at the <a href="https://scripps.ucsd.edu/">Scripps Institution of Oceanography</a> and the <a href="http://ucsd.edu/">University of California, San Diego</a>. I did my undergraduate degree in Chemistry at <a href="http://www.earlham.edu/">Earlham College</a> - a small liberal arts college in Richmond, Indiana. I am broadly interested in the physiology of iron metabolism in marine heterotrophic bacteria and phytoplankton and its effects on extra-cellular iron chemistry and speciation. Currently, I use biochemistry, synthetic biology, and bioinformatics to study iron uptake and assimilation pathways in lab cultured and unculturable marine bacteria.

<p>I am slowly learning to be a bioinformaticist and work primarily in ruby and R. Right now I'm trying get up to speed with python as it seems to be quickly becoming the standard language for the bioinformatics community (sorry perl). Also I thought this might be a good opportunity to try out <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, which I am using to make this blog. Topics will range from bioinformatics code snippets to rantings on navigating the mazes of academia.</p>

<p>If you like you can get a hold of me <a href="mailto:shogle@ucsd.edu" target="_top"> here</a>. Or you can bug me on <a href="http://twitter.com/slhogle">Twitter</a></p>
